<p>Seven Sisters Country Park is a unique place. It comprises 280 hectares of chalk cliffs, meandering river valley and open chalk grassland.</p>

<p>It’s home to grazing sheep, rare flora and fauna and is a corridor for a large number of migrating birds. </p>

<p>The river Cuckmere cuts right through the Park and visitors can follow the adjacent footpath from the Visitors Centre to the coast.</p>


<h2>Shaftesbury</h2>

<p>Shaftesbury is a small market town in Dorset with a fascinating history going back to Saxon times.  The town is the home of Gold Hill (made famous by the “Hovis” advert) and has magnificent views over Thomas Hardy’s Blackmore Vale.  It is the gateway to the South West from where you can tour the area from Stonehenge to the east to Bath and Bristol to the north and the Jurassic Coast to the south.</p>

<p>Nobody does festivals and events like North Dorset does and here we’ve selected what we consider to be the 17 best, chosen to reflect the sheer diversity and class of festivals in the region.  </p>

<h2>Bath</h2>

<p>Built for pleasure and relaxation, beautiful Bath has been a wellbeing destination since Roman times. The waters are still a big draw, both at the ancient Roman Baths and the thoroughly modern Thermae Bath Spa, which houses the only natural thermal hot springs in Britain you can bathe in..</p>

<p>Bath’s compact, visitor-friendly centre is overflowing with places to eat and drink, plus some of the finest independent shops in Britain, making it the ideal city break. Immerse yourself in Bath’s remarkable collection of museums and galleries, and enjoy year-round festivals, theatre, music and sports. </p>

<p>Bath's stunning honey-coloured Georgian architecture is straight from a Jane Austen novel – highlights include the iconic Royal Crescent and the majestic Circus. There’s plenty to see beyond the city, too, with stunning Somerset countryside to explore, as well as attractions like Stonehenge, Avebury and Longleat Safari Park.</p>

<h2>Wells</h2>

<p>The historic City of Wells is just a short 45 minute drive from the beautiful City of Bath (UNESCO World Heritage City). The 22 mile route heads over the Mendip Hills and opens up a gateway to the one of England's less explored gems - Somerset. Wells makes an ideal destination for a short break or long weekend and has much to see in it as well as providing an excellent base for exploring the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Wells is a medieval city nestling on the southern side of the Mendip Hills with the mystic Somerset Levels stretching away to the south and west. The history of Wells goes right back to Roman times when we know that there was a settlement, probably because of the springs that bubble up here. Wells gets its name from these springs which can today be found in the gardens of the Bishop's Palace.</p>
