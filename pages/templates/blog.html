<p>It may surprise you to know that we are actually a UK family travel blog. I am British, I was born and raised in Wales and my kids were born in London. We left the UK to travel and have returned for long trips and visits many times.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is more correctly known as The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, The UK or U.K. It is a sovereign country separated from the main European continent by water.It is a part of the continent of Europe, but Brexit is yet to determine if it will remain part of the European Union. </p>

<p>The United Kingdom consists of four countries, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.The UK and England are not the same thing.</p>
<p>The British Isles are different again. The British Isles consist of the islands of Great Britain (the mainland), Ireland, The Channel Isles, The Isle of White, the Hebrides, and over six thousand smaller isles.</p>

<p>The world has changed, more for some than others, and the UK has been massively affected. Many people in the UK will be holidaying at home this year or maybe taking a staycation. That’s not a bad thing if you see the positives. The UK is beautiful and has much to offer. As a family travel blog and a general travel blog, we recommend a lot of attractions in the UK. Some will still be closed. Some beaches and outdoor places will still be closed. Wales, Scotland and England all have different levels of restriction. We’re working hard to find you the latest travel information from the UK, but things are changing almost daily. Please double check everything very close to your proposed time of travel.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to immerse yourself in city life then London is your answer, but if that’s a little too big or busy for you then head north to Leeds or Liverpool for almost everything our capital has to offer but on a smaller scale. Then you have our famed historical cities like Cambridge, Oxford and Bath which will make you feel like you’re walking through the set of a period drama.</p>
